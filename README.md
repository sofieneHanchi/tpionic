-My First Ionic Project-
This project was realized when learning VueJs followed by Ionic 3.
In order to test the source code. You need to launch a json-server with the existing file "db.json".
The available routes for now are :
"/home" : To add a new entity of "Etudiant"
"/affichage" : It shows the information of the entered entity
"/etudiants" : It displays all of the existing entities, with the possibility to delete/modify them
"/etudiants/:id" : It is the interface for modifying an entity.
It's not much, But it's honest work !
